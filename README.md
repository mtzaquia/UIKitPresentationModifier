# UIKitPresentationModifier

A modifier allowing you to present `UIKit` controllers natively from a `SwiftUI` context.

## Instalation

UIKitPresentationModifier is available via Swift Package Manager.

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/mtzaquia/UIKitPresentationModifier.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0")),
],
```

## Usage

The magic happens with the `.presentation(...)` modifier. Simply declare it as you'd normally do with `.sheet(...)` or `.fullScreenCover(...)`. The key difference here is that you need to provide a `UIViewController` which will configure the presentation, unlocking all the flexibility from `UIKit` presentations into your `SwiftUI` context.

```swift
myPresentingView
  .presentation(isPresented: $isPresented) {
    MyPresentedView()
  } controllerProvider: { content in
    let controller = UIHostingController(rootView: content)
    if #available(iOS 15, *) {
      if let sheet = controller.sheetPresentationController {
        sheet.preferredCornerRadius = 12
        sheet.prefersGrabberVisible = true
      }
    }
    
    return controller
  }
```
